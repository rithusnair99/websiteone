<center><h1>HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL</h1></center>
<pre><h3>
- The application layer protocol used by all Web communications
- HTTP consists of two phases: (current version 1.1)
- the request and the response.
- Each HTTP communication (request or response) between a browser and a Web server 
consists of two parts: a header and a body. 
- The header contains information about the communication;
- the body contains the data of the communication if there is any
- An HTTP session is a sequence of network request-response transactions. 
- An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
connection to a particular port on a server.
- An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the 
request, the server sends back a status line, such as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", and a message of its own

→ Request Phase
- Form: 
a)HTTP method domain part of URL HTTP ver.
b)Header fields
c )blank line
d) Message body

a) -An example of the first line of a request:
GET /ktu.edu/degrees.html HTTP/1.1

- Most commonly used methods:
GET - Fetch a document and returns the content of specification
POST - Execute the document, using the enclosed data in body
HEAD - Fetch just the header of the document
PUT – replace the specific doc/Store a new document on the server
DELETE - Remove a document from the serve 

b)Header fields-
-Information about the communication
-format of header field
field-name followed by colon and value

4 categories of header fields
-General→for general information like date
-Request→included in request headers
-Response→for response headers
-Entity→used in both request and response

→One common request field is Accept
Ex) Accept:text/plain
Accept:image/gif
Accept:text/html
→Header provides additional information about the data that will be sent
Ex)content-type:text/html
→Host→hostname request field gives the name of the host
→Client request
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
A client request ( in this request line and only one header field) is followed by a blank line,used to 
separate the header from the body

Response Phase
- Form:
a)Status line
b)Response header fields
c)blank line
d)Response body

a) - Status line format:
HTTP version status code explanation
- Example: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
(Current version is 1.1)
- Status code is a three-digit number; first digit specifies the general status
1 => Informational
2 => Success
3 => Redirection
4 => Client error
5 => Server error

404→Not found
500→Internal Server error
200→OK
b)After the status line server sends a response header , contain several lines of information 
about the response. 
Content-type:text/html
c)Response header followed by blank line
d)Response data follows the blank line

RESPONSE FIELDS
• ETag (entity tag) header field is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is
identical to the current version of the resource on the server.
• Content-Type specifies the Internet media type of the data conveyed by the HTTP message
• Content-Length indicates its length in bytes.
• Accept-Ranges: bytes: HTTP/1.1 webserver publishes its ability to respond to requests for certain byte 
ranges of the document by setting the field Accept-Ranges: bytes.
• Connection: close is sent, it means that the web server will close theTCP connection immediately 
after the transfer of this response.
• Most of the header lines are optional.
• A Content-Encoding can be used to compress the transmitted data.</pre></h3>
