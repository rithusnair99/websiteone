<center><h1>what the internet is:</h1></center>
<pre><h3>Definition of Internet

→A world-wide network of computer networks
-N/w of N/W’s and different devices in the network communicates with each other based on the 
low level protocol TCP/IP(Transport layer).


WHAT THE INTERNET IS:

→TCP/IP standard allows a program on one computer to communicate with a program on another 
computer via internet
→Not every computer on internet directly connects to every other computer
→Individual computers in an organization can be connected each other in a local network.



3.Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses

→ Every node has a unique numeric address
→ Form : IPv4 : 32-bit binary number
→Four 8 bit numbers separated by periods x.x.x.x ranges 0 to 255
→New standard, IPv6, has 128 bits (1998)
→An IPv6 address is represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group 
representing 16 bits . The groups are separated by colons (:). 
The hexadecimal digits are case-insensitive,
→ An example of an IPv6 address is:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
 IPv4 - IP address as a 32-bit value
• IPv6 addresses have a size of 128 bits. 
• IPv6 has a vastly enlarged address space compared to IPv4.
• IP consists of two parts
-N/W ID & Host ID
→Organization are assigned to machine with block of IP
→It will be assigned to machines that need internet
ex)small organization(256 IP address)
191.57.126.0 to 191.57.126.256
Large organization(16 million IP)
12.0.0.0 to 12.255.255.255
• HTTPApplication
• TCP-Transport
• IP-Network 
Layer
• Data Link Layer
• PHYsical Layer


.DOMAIN NAMES

→Domains are used to identify the machine(in addition to IP) in a network.
→It is difficult to remember number to identify machines on net.
→Domain begin with host name followed by one or more domain names
Form: host-name.domain-names
Ex) www.cars.maruthi.org
- First domain is the smallest; last is the largest
- Last domain specifies the type of organization
→ Fully qualified domain name - the host name and all of the domain names
→Domain names must be converted to IP address before the message can be transmitted over the 
internet to the destination.It is done using DNS.
