<center><h1>WEB SERVER</h1></center>
<pre><h3>→Provide responses to browser requests, either existing documents or dynamically built 
documents
→Browser-server connection is now maintained through more than one request-response 
cycle
→All communications between browsers and servers use Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
(HTTP)
→Web servers run as background processes in the operating system
→Monitor a communications port on the host, accepting HTTP messages when they appear

→ All current Web servers came from either
1. The original from CERN
2. The second one, from NCSA



Operation of web servers

• Web browsers initiate a network communication with servers by sending a request using URL
• All communications between browsers and servers use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
• When web server begins execution it informs the OS under which it is running ,that it is ready 
to accept incoming n/w connection through a specific port 
• Performs operations specified by the commands
• Returned the response
• After receiving the response web client closes the connection. 


→Web servers have two main directories:
1. Document root (stores the web documents)
2. Server root (server & its support system software)

→ Document root is accessed indirectly by clients
→Its actual location is set by the server configuration file
→Requests are mapped to the actual location
→Files stored in document root are available through the top-level URL
→Clients do not access document root directly in URL’s
→Server maps requested URL to the document root,whose location is not known to clients.
→ex)www.abc.com→/admin/web/htdocs/index.html


Web browsers initiate network communications with 
servers by sending them URLs .
• A URL can specify one of two different things:
• the address of a data file stored on the server that is to be 
sent to the client, or
• a program stored on the server that the client wants 
executed, with the output of the program returned to the 
client.
• All the communications between a Web client and a Web 
server use the standard Web protocol, Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol (HTTP)

• When a Web server begins execution, it informs the
operating system under which it is running that it is now
ready to accept incoming network connections through a
specific port on the machine.
• A Web client, or browser, opens a network connection to a
Web server, sends information requests and possibly data to
the server, receives information from the server, and closes
the connection.
• The primary task of a Web server is to monitor a
communications port on its host machine, accept HTTP
commands through that port, and perform the operations
specified by the commands.</pre></h3>
