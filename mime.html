<center><h1>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension(MIME)</h1></center>
<pre><h3>
- Originally developed for email 
- Browser needs a format of the document it receives from a web server.
- MIME Specifies the format of different kinds of docs
- Without knowing the form of the document ,browsers would not be able to render it . 
- Used to specify to the browser the form of a file returned by the server 
- Web server attaches MIME format specification to the beginning of the document ,to provide to 
a browser.
- When browser receives the document ,it uses MIME format specification to determine what to 
do with the document.
- If content is text→MIME code tells the browser that it is text
- If content is sound→browser will choose a program to access the transmitted sound.

→Type specifications
- Form: type/subtype
- Common MIME types 1) text 2) images 3) video

-SubTypes
text →plain ,html
images→gif,jpeg
video→mpeg,quicktime
→Examples: text/plain, text/html, image/gif,image/jpeg
→ Server gets type from the requested file name’s suffix (.html implies text/html)
→ Browser gets the type explicitly from the server
→ Experimental types
- Subtype begins with x- e.g., video/x-msvideo
→ Experimental types require the server to send a helper application or plug-in so the browser can 
deal with the file

→List of MIME spec is stored in configuration files of every Web Server.
→Every browser has a set of MIME specification it can handle.
Ex)unformatted text→text/plain
HTML files→text/html
→if browser does not have helper application/plug-in to render a doc,an error message is displayed
→Style elements type attributes specifies the MIME type that describes the files content.
Style uses → <style type=“text/css”>
Javascript uses → <script type=“text/javascript”>
Img uses → ”images/gif”</pre></h3>
