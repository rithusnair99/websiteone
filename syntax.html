<center><h1>Basic Syntax</h1></center>
<h3><pre>Elements are defined by tags (markers)

Tag format:
Opening tag: <p>
Closing tag: </p>
The opening tag and its closing tag together specify a container for the content they enclose

Not all tags have content
If a tag has no content, its form is <br/>

The container and its content together are called an element
Many tags have attributes.  An attribute more fully specifies information about the content of the container.
If a tag has attributes, they appear between its name and the right bracket of the opening tag
Comment form: <!-- â€¦ -->
Browsers ignore comments, unrecognizable tags, line breaks, multiple spaces, and tabs

The Document Tree 
The elements in a web page are contained in a tree structure in which html is the root element that splits into the head and body elements 
The element is created by writing an opening tag, and completed by writing a closing tag
the opening and closing tags must be symmetrical
If an opening paragraph tag is followed by the opening element, the closing tags must appear in the reverse order
